= CodeSync =

This is a mac utility that uses rsync to immediately synchronize file
changes to a server or remote computer, as you work.

NOTE: Since it uses rsync to communicate with the server, it is important
to setup public/private keys: http://bit.ly/PcTRK

CodeSync uses a project file (see example below) that tells it how to connect to 
the server and which directories to keep in sync.

== INSTALL ==
To install CodeSync run:

  sudo ./install
  
== PASSWORDS and PUBLIC/PRIVATE KEYS ==
Each time rsync communicates with the server it'll ask for your password, which is
really annoying, unless you setup public/private keys.

Follow the instructions at the following URL to be able to sync without passwords:

== EXAMPLE PROJECT FILE ==

   # Server details
   server="jgillick-md.linkedin.biz"
   username="jgillick"

   # Base directories to sync from/to
   remote_basedir="/Users/jgillick/LinkedIn/svn/network"
   local_basedir="/Users/jeremy/Linkedin/Remote"

   # The directories to sync, relative to the base directories
   sync_dirs=[ "content/leo/static/js",
               "content/leo/static/css",
               "leo/gui-impl/jsp" ]
               
   # sync_dirs=[  ] # This will sync the entire base directories

   # The contents of these directories will only sync "up" to the server.
   # This means the contents will never be downloaded from the server
   # but files added or changed locally will be sent to the server
   sync_up=[ "content/leo/static/img" ]

== BASE DIRECTORIES vs SYNC DIRECTORIES ==
The base directories are where everything happens on the local and server.
Often times, if you're working with a large code base, you wont want to download and 
sync ALL the files. In this case you define the directories you'll be working on in the 
sync_dirs array.

If you don't want to download a directory, but upload any changes to the server, you can
add those directory paths to the sync_up directory.
